<p>Lies. Lies. Lies. They’re all around us. What makes them? Do we? Are they in our nature or are they learned?</p>

<p>Where ever I go I manage to find clever, little lies. Out Shopping. At work. At home. I can’t avoid it. It’s not rational. I don’t understand it. Well, maybe I do. Because I do lie. And doing something irrational makes me crazy, right?</p>

<p>All this to say, I fucking hate lying. If you’re faced with a scenario where you need to lie, just tell the truth. You’d be no worse off than if you’re caught in it. And odds are, you’re probably shit at it anyway.</p>
