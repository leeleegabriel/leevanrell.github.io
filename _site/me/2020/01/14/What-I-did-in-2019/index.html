    <p>I know this is probably coming a little late compared to some. But thats just who I am.</p>

<p>I just graduated in December of 2018. So the first quarter of 2018 was filled with applications and anxiety. Eventually, I got a job as a Software Engineer. However, through the past 8 months, I’ve learned that title is much more of a formality than anything else. I’ve become a sme in things I didn’t know existed 12 months ago and mildly knowledgeable of even more. I regularly get to wear the hat of a Software Engineer, Red teamer, Blue Teamer, RF Engineer, and Systems Engineer all in the same day.</p>

<p>I attended a few conferences, Showmecon and GRCon to name a few. Unfortunately time slipped me by and I couldn’t attend BSides HSV.At GRCon, I was floored by the massive knowledge base I was surrounded by. Everyone there was a contributor to GNURadio itself or a wildly popular OOT like <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites">gr-satellites</a>. If you aren’t familiar, this project has software to capture and demodulate the signal of several dozen active satellites. Its an amazing.
One talk about <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/grcon/grcon19/presentations/determining_optimized_radio_settings_for_specific_waveforms/Determining%20Optimized%20Radio%20settings%20for%20specific%20waveforms_GRCon2019.pdf">ads-b</a> inspired me to write a ads-b transmitter as an entry to the world of SDR. And I was successful. I was suprised at how easy it was (humble brag). However, I’m afraid of the reprocussions for releasing the code, so I’m afraid it will stay buried.</p>

<p>Besides the world of conferences and sdrs. I’ve develled into 3d printing and design. I’m still quite a novice, but I’ve made a few designed that I hope to post to thingiverse soon. They include a Raspberrypi case and camera holder, a showmecon badge, and a case for a stock ticker like 64x8 led matrix.</p>

<p>I’ve started studying for Security+, CISSP, and CEH. This is all required by my work and has triggered horrible war-like flashbacks to studying in college.</p>

<p>I started toying with C/CUDA because parrallelization get me hot and heavy. However, I haven’t even successfully compiled any CUDA code yet, but a boy can dream.</p>

<p>I helped make my first <a href="fuckcliff.me">site</a> (besides this one). I toyed with a new JS framework called Svelte/Sapper. Unfortanetly Web dev scares me so I’ll save it for another time.</p>

<p>I got to visit my friends in DC around the Holidays and have fell in love with the city. I hope to live there one day. Plus I miss my friends, so thats a plus.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are a great deal of things I’m forgetting but this is what I remembered so this must be what’s important. Atleast to me.</p>
