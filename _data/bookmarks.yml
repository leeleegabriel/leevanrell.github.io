  excerpt: "This year, we saw a dazzling application of machine learning. The OpenAI\
    \ GPT-2 exhibited impressive ability of writing coherent and passionate essays\
    \ that exceed what we anticipated current language models are able to produce.\
    \ The GPT-2 wasn\u2019t a particularly novel architecture \u2013 it\u2019s architecture\
    \ is very similar to the decoder-only transformer. The GPT2 was, however, a very\
    \ large, transformer-based language model trained on a massive dataset. In this\
    \ post, we\u2019ll look at the architecture that enabled the model to produce\
    \ its results.   "

  excerpt: After the announcement of shell access for builds.sr.ht jobs, a few people
    sent me some questions, wondering how this sort of thing is done. Writing interactive
    SSH applications is actually pretty easy, but it does require some knowledge of
    the pieces involved and a little bit of general Unix literacy.
